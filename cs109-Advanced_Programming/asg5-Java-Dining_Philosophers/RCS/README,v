Assignment: asg4

   This assignment contains:
      README
      Makefile
      Fork.java
      Philosopher.java
      DiningPhilosophers.java

************************************************************************

   Makefile: partially written by Wesley Mackey
             Note: Includes my own ci command called "cil" that is only
             called for my user names dmfrank and derekmfrank.
             Otherwise Mackey's "cid" command is called.
