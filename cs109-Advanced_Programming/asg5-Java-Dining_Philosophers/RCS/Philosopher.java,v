 *
 * NAME
 *    Philosophers
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *    A class that implements Runnable.  Used to create a Thread.  An
 *    abstract object describing a Philosopher sitting at a table with
 *    a Fork object to his left and to his right.  This philosopher has
 *    two specified amounts of time in milliseconds to eat and think.
 *    When the Philosopher is eating or thinking, the sleep() method is
 *    called.  The Philosopher can only think when it is not holding
 *    either of its Fork objects.  The Philosopher can only eat when it
 *    is holding both its Fork objects.  It cannot eat or think when
 *    holding only a single Fork object.  The Philosopher also has a
 *    handedness specification to determine which Fork object it tries
 *    to pick up first.
