   Makefile: partially written by Wesley Mackey
             Includes my own ci command called "cil" that is only called
             for my user names dmfrank and derekmfrank.  Otherwise
             Mackey's "cid" command is called.

      make_text(): Assumes only one space is inserted between words.   
      startpage(): Since printing file name, page number, date, and time
                   is not specified to be printed in the header similar
                   to the draw.perl output, assuming just printing file
                   name and page number in the footer is okay.  As this
                   was how the user code was given.
