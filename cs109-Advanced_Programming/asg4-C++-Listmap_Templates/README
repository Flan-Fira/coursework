   Makefile: partially written by Wesley Mackey
             Note: Includes my own ci command called "cil" that is only
             called for my user names dmfrank and derekmfrank.
             Otherwise Mackey's "cid" command is called.

   util.h: written by Wesley Mackey

   util.cpp: written by Wesley Mackey

   list.h:   

   list.cpp: 
             Notes:
             1)  Although I include pop(), I find I do not use it
             since my destructor takes care of memory leak and I have
             no need to remove any elements from a list, just retrieve
             them.  I realize I could have used pop() inside of
             operator<<, but I do not find that an efficient use of the
             operator<<.  And no where in the assignment was it required
             to remove any elements from the list.

   main.cpp:
