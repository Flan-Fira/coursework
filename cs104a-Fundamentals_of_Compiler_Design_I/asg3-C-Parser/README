************************************************************************

    Miscellaneous:
        Although Mackey did not specify to dump the astree to
            "program.ast" with removal of the prefix "TOK_", he did
            suggest it and so I have removed that prefix to follow the
            output style he presented us in out specifications. 

    Makefile:
        Note that the ci command is altered based on the user.

    main.c:
        Partially written by Wesley Mackey as many functions were taken
            or altered from both his Examples/e08-expr-smc/main.c and
            Assignments/cppstrtok/cppstrtok.c files.
        Code for remove_ext() was attained from:
            http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2736753/how-to-remove-
            extension-from-file-name

    scanner.l:
        Partially written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from 
            Examples/e08.expr-smc.

    parser.y:
        Partially written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from 
            Assignments/misc-code and Examples/e08.expr-smc.
        Some actions are long for necessary reasons such as changing
            symbols, freeing astrees, creating new astrees for function
            and prototype, and just adopting astrees.
        I have created functions in "lyutils.c", new_funcnode() and 
            new_protonode(), that will create astrees for a function
            token and a prototype token.  These functions take one
            parameter that is an astree so that the astree created
            can use the astree's file number, line number, and offset.

    lyutils.c:
        Partially written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from
            Examples/e08.expr-smc.

    lyutils.h:
        Partially written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from
            Examples/e08.expr-smc.

    astree.c
        Mostly written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from
            Examples/e08.expr-smc.

    astree.rep.h
        Written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from Examples/e08.expr-smc.

    astree.h
        Written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from Examples/e08.expr-smc.

    stringtable.c:
        The hashing function strhash() was taken from Wesley Mackey's
            file strhash.c in Examples/e08.expr-smc.

    stringtable.h:
        Written by Wesley Mackey as taken from the assignment
            specifications.

    auxlib.c:
        Written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from Examples/e08.expr-smc.

    auxlib.h:
        Written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from Examples/e08.expr-smc.
