    This asignment includes:
        README
        Makefile

        stringtable.c
        auxlib.h
        auxlib.c
        main.c

************************************************************************

    Makefile:
        Note that the ci command is altered based on the user.

    stringtable.h:
        Written by Wesley Mackey as taken from the assignment
        specifications.

    stringtable.c:
        The hashing function strhash() was taken from Wesley Mackey's
        file strhash.c in Examples/e08-expr-smc.

    auxlib.h:
        Written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from Examples/e08-expr-smc.

    auxlib.c:
        Written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from Examples/e08-expr-smc.

    main.c:
        Partially written by Wesley Mackey as many functions were taken
        or altered from both his Examples/e08-expr-smc/main.c and
        Assignments/cppstrtok/cppstrtok.c files.
        Code for remove_ext() was attained from:
            http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2736753/how-to-remove-
            extension-from-file-name
        Note that if there is no file specified that an error is thrown,
        since CPP will simply read from stdin.
