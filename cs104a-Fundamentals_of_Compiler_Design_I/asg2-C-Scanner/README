    Makefile:
        Note that the ci command is altered based on the user.

    main.c:
        Partially written by Wesley Mackey as many functions were taken
            or altered from both his Examples/e08-expr-smc/main.c and
            Assignments/cppstrtok/cppstrtok.c files.
        Code for remove_ext() was attained from:
            http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2736753/how-to-remove-
            extension-from-file-name
        Note that if there is no file specified that an error is thrown,
            since CPP will simply read from stdin.
        It is important to note that I have designed the compiler so
            that if the CPP pipe, yyin, closes with an error then the
            "program.str" file will not be created, such as when 
            "nosuch.oc" is used; however, since yylex() must be run
            while the pipe to yyin is still open, it was not possible to
            keep it from opening given a failed pipe.  It is just
            necessary to note that I have chosen not to create such 
            files when such a crucial error occurs. 

    scanner.l:
        Partially written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from 
            Examples/e08.expr-smc.

    parser.y:
        Written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from Assignments/misc-code.

    lyutils.c:
        Written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from Examples/e08.expr-smc.

    lyutils.h:
        Written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from Examples/e08.expr-smc.
        Contains two extra extern variables of type char* and FILE*:
            basenamefile: type char* that holds to the stripped name of
                the given "directory/program.oc" so that it simply holds
                "program".
            tokfile: type FILE* since it is opened in lyutils.c and
                closed in main.c.

    astree.c
        Written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from Examples/e08.expr-smc.

    astree.rep.h
        Written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from Examples/e08.expr-smc.

    astree.h
        Written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from Examples/e08.expr-smc.

    stringtable.c:
        The hashing function strhash() was taken from Wesley Mackey's
            file strhash.c in Examples/e08.expr-smc.

    stringtable.h:
        Written by Wesley Mackey as taken from the assignment
            specifications.

    auxlib.c:
        Written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from Examples/e08.expr-smc.

    auxlib.h:
        Written by Wesley Mackey.  Taken from Examples/e08.expr-smc.
