Makefile:
    - The Makefile will build the dependencies file, the object files,
      and the executable file "evs" using "gcc" with the options
      "-g -O0 -Wall -Wextra -std=gnu99".
    Commands:
        make
         - will build the everything using gcc
        make clean
         - will remove all files produced except the executable
        make spotless
         - will remove all files produced

auxlib.c/h:
    - Extra utility functions written by Wesley Mackey.

list.c/h:
    - Just a queue like structure specifically designed to handle
      candidates, votes, and voter IDs.

evs: executable
    - All arguments will be ignored, but the program will still run.
    - Can handle multiple connections, but only handles one at a time.
      Keeps the rest waiting until it finishes with the current
      connection.
    - ^C will exit the program.
