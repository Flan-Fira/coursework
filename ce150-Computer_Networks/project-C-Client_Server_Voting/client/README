evc: executable
    - When running the client, the user must provide the option
      -s with an IP address.
    - If the -v options is present, then both the voter ID and
      candidate name should be given.
    - evc will not accept extra arguments than the options and a voter
      ID.
    - If an argument exceeds 255 characters, then an error will be
      produced, a message will be sent to stderr, and the program
      will exit.
    - All candidate names are converted to all lower case letters to
      prevent ambiguity.
    - A message is printed if the vote was successful or unsuccessful,
      due to the voter ID number having already voted.
    Results Format: printf ("   %20s     %3d\n", candidateName, votes);
