Project 4: README - protectfile

This README is for the protectfile portion of the assignment.  The Makefile
provided in this directory is used to build and test the program.  The
Makefile will test with a 16 character key, but feel free to change it or
the name of the test file, which are both variables in Makefile.

MAKEFILE COMMANDS:

  make all
    Will build the protectfile executable.

  make test
    Will set up the test file, build the executable, and test both
    protecting (encrypting) and unprotecting (decrypting) the test file.

  make teste
    Will not work without setting up the test file or running "make test"
    first.  Tests the "e" flag functionality of the program.

  make testd
    Will not work without setting up the test file or running "make test"
    first.  Tests the "d" flag functionality of the program.
    
  make clean
   Removes all object files in the directory.

  make spotless
    Removes the executable, object files, and test file.
