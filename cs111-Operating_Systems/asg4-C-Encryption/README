Project 4: README

  There are two useful Makefiles for this project.  One exists in the
current/primary directory and is used to setup the setkey component of
this assignment by moving all of the necessary files to the correct place
in the Minix system.  It does not actually compile the kernel or libraries.
That must be done by hand and is explained below.  The second Makefile
is in the protectfile directory and is used to build and test that
component of the project.

MAKEFILE COMMANDS:
  make
    Runs setkey setup.
  
  make sksetup
    Same as default.

INSTRUCTIONS: Compile kernel for setkey

  bash-$ cd /usr/src/servers
