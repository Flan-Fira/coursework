README - semaphore testing

NOTES:
  This directory contains a Makefile to build all the files on Minix3.
  Also, there is a run.sh script for testing the files.  When testing
  a kernel chosen sem id by passing 0 to seminit, one must manually free
  or test, since the sem id is not known.  The value is printed to stdout
  so that it may be known and passed manually.

Note: Be sure run.sh is executable.  Should be, but sometimes
      transferring files changes that bit.

USAGE:
  bash-$ make
  bash-$ ./run.sh
