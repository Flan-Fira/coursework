README - alien synchronization problem

NOTES:
  There is a Makefile included for this alien synchronization problem
  that will compile the three files on Minix3.  It is important to note
  that when running an alien, the user must specify both its gender
  and number of times to reproduce (i.e., get back in line).  It is
  probably a good idea to set all the aliens to the same number of
  reproductions so that the chance of a sleeping process left on a
  semaphore process queue is minimized.  Such an error is the fault
  of the user.  Also a good idea to run the aliens as background
  processes.  Freeing the semaphores is done after running the alien
  instances to prevent catastrophe. 

Note: Be sure run.sh is executable.  Should be, but sometimes
      transferring files changes that bit.

USAGE:
  bash-$ make
  bash-$ ./run.sh
  bash-$ ./freealiens
