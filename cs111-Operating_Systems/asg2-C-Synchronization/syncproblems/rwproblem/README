README - readers/writers synchronization problem

NOTES:
  This directory should include both a Makefile to build
  the executables and a run.sh script to test the files.
  Note that freeing things should be done separately
  after running the script to allow the processes to
  finish with the semaphores.  

Note: Be sure run.sh is executable.  Should be, but sometimes
      transferring files changes that bit.

USAGE:
  bash-$ make
  bash-$ ./run.sh
  bash-$ ./freerw
