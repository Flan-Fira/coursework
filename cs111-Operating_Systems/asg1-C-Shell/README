   Makefile
   README
   shell.c

Description:
   auxlib.c
       An implementation file for useful functions written by Wesley
       Mackey.

   auxlib.h
       An interface file for useful functions written by Wesley Mackey.

   design.txt
       The design document associated with this assignment.

   Makefile
       A Makefile to build the program with gcc.
       Commands:
           make
             - produces the binary myshell
           make all
             - produces the binary myshell
           make clean
             - cleans the directory by removing object files, dependency
               files, and possibly a core dump.
           make spotless
             - same as clean, but also removes the binary executable
           make deps
             - creates a dependency file

   Makefile-linux
       A Makefile that I used on my Linux OS, but would not work as is on
       minix.

   shell.c
       The main program.


Notes:
   I was unable to complete the piping aspect of the project.
