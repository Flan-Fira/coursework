README

Makefile:
  Builds the executable as well as the static library.

run.sh:
  First builds the executable with make and then runs the tester.

NOTE:
  Be sure to move all files to /root, i.e., the home directory for root.
  If you change directories, then change the DIR variable inside of the
  Makefile.

  Use run.sh to test.  Two methods if one does not work:
    ./run.sh
    bash run.sh
  Sometimes ./run.sh will not work properly on Minix so one of these cases 
  should work.  You should not have to modify the 'x' bit, but it is a
  possibility.
