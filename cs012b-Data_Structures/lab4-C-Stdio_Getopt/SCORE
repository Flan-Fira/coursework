For any point deduction, note it in the left margin and add a
comment under it indicating why the loss of points.  Assign a
point value for each between 0 and the max indicated in parens.

Lint: Do not deduct points for the msssage:
   function returns value which is always ignored
       printf fprintf fclose
and other common functions whose return values are usually ignored.

*****************************************************************

CODE = 15 points

   Add up the following out of 15.  If the total is 16,
   record 15 instead.  (One free error.)

   (2) checksource did not complain

   (2) lint did not complain (except OK as spec above)

   (2) options analysis code using getopt

   (2) catfile prints titles if -m

   (2) catfile prints line numbers "%6d  " if -n

   (2) counts and suppresses multiple lines if -s

   (2) catfile prints visibly if -v

   (2) iterates over all files as required

   = total/15

*****************************************************************

TESTING = 15 points

   ./mk.build
   ./mk.tests

   If mk.build did not create an executable image, assign 0 points
   for this section.  If it did create an exec imag, then:

   (1) exit status was correct in all cases
       (0 for OK, 1 for errors to stderr)

   (2) error messages to stderr, not stdout

   (2) reading from files worked

   (2) stdin test worked.  also worked for - as stdin

   (2) -m option worked

   (2) -n option worked

   (2) -s option worked

   (2) -v option worked

   If any of the tests produced a segment fault or bus error
   deduct 5 points from the total for this section, but do not
   record less than 0 for this section.

   = total/15

If not, TOTALSCORE = SUBTOTAL.
