PartB:
(1):
  i)   The given quadratic equation, x^2+b*x+c=0, has two roots,
     r1(b)=(-b+sqrt(b^2-4*c))/2 and r2(b)=(-b-sqrt(b^2-4*c))/2.
     Since c is set to equal 1, c=1, the two roots are functions
     of b.  Using Matlab, I have to plot these functions for when
     b is between [2,3].

  ii)  Using Matlab code to plot 100 points for each function, I
     attain a 2-dimensional graph with two lines.

  iii) The resulting graph is that of a sideways parabola opening
     to the right.  The vertex is at (2,-1).  The roots, r1 and r2,
     are reflections of the other over the line y=-1.

(2):
  i)   Given f(x,y)=sin(x^2+y^2)*exp(-sprt(x^2+y^2)), I am going
     to use Matlab to plot the function when x is between [-3,3]
     and y is between [-3,3].

  ii)  Using Matlab code to plot the function with 30 points, I
     attain a 3-dimensional graph of a surface.

  iii) The resulting graph appears like the look of water after
     dropping something heavy into it.  A large ring, like a wave,
     is surrounded by smaller wave rings with a cave-in in the
     center.  The surface is limited in height to under .4 and
     contained above -.4.

(3):
  i)   Given a file "data1.txt" and a fitting function (a function
     that resembles the given data points when plotted), 
     f(x)=exp(-c*x)*cos(2*x), I need to find an approximation for
     the value of c and use Matlab to plot the given data and
     fitting function.

  ii)  To find an approximation for c I take a look at the values
     for x and y in the file "data1.txt" and plug them into the
     given fitting function and solve for c.  I do this for when
     x=2,3,4,5,6 and attain five different values of c.  I take
     the average of these values to attain the best approximation
     and find that c approximately equals .2295528077.  I use this
     value of c in Matlab to plot the function and after loading
     and plotting the data in "data1.txt" I attain a 2-dimensional
     graph.

  iii) The fitting curve is not perfect so that is contains the
     exact same data points as plotted from "data1.txt," but it
     follows the same shape.  The curve is similar to a cosine
     function because it is wave-like, yet the wave gets smaller
     as x gets bigger.  y appears to be approaching 0 as x gets
     large.
