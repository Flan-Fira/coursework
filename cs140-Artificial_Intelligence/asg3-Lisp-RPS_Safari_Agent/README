Submitting two agent files.  One is formatted and readable, while the other
is completely the opposite.  Both files run on a Linux-x64 machine.  The
non-formatted version exceeds 150 lines a bit, but is consistent with the
ideal of how many characters could fit in 150 lines by 80 characters.

150 * 80 = 12000
character count of dmfrank-p3.lisp: 11919
