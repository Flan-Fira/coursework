   functions.pl: 
                - In a few of the tests I am uncertain if it is
                expected in the output to display errors.  In
                particular, group.tests 1 and 2.  I checked
                myself and verified that given the rules that no
                flight can end after 24:00 and that there must be a
                30 minute transfer period between flights give reason
                to the errors printed with those tests.  It may also
                be the case that there is simply no path available.

                - It also says in the SCORE file that group3.tests
                should complain about zero-fly queries.  This seems
                that we should complain that a successful fly query
                was not achieved, however, I am assuming that it is
                sufficient enough to simply complain that the 
                departure and the destination are one in the same.
                Complaining about zero-fly queries does not make
                much sense to me for this.
