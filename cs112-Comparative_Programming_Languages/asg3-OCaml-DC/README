   Makefile: partially written by Wesley Mackey
             Includes my own ci command called "cil" that is only called
             for my user names dmfrank, derekmfrank, and fain.
             Otherwise, Mackey's "cid" command is called.

   bigint.ml: partially by Wesley Mackey
              There are two attempts at creating the mul function, but I
              found it too difficult to complete in time so they are 
              commented out.
