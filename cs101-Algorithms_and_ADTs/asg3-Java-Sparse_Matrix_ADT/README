  List.java:
    A linked list for Objects with markers to keep track of the
  front and rear of the double ended queue.  Includes a current-
  position marker that can move to previous and next positions.
  
  Matrix.java:
    A class representing a sparse (the number of non-zero entries
  is small compared to the total number of entries) n*n matrix of
  double values.  Contains a List array that holds Objects.  The
  Object specified by Matrix to be contained in a List is a
  private inner class, Entry, that contains the column entry
  along with its corresponding double value.  This class is
  capable of performing specified Matrix operations that exploits
  the (expected) sparseness of it's Matrix operands.
  
  MatrixTest.java:
    A class made specifically to run and test Matrix.java and
  List.java to see how they function.
  
  Sparse.java:
    Sparse.java is the main class to implement the classes
  Matrix.java and List.java.  It takes two arguments from the
  command line: input_file output_file.  Sparse reads input from
  specified input_file, then stores the information into two
  Matrices.  Sparse then performs calculations on these Matrices
  and writes the output to the specified output_file.
  
  Makefile
    Used to compile Sparse.java, MatrixTest.java, Matrix.java,
  and List.java on Unix.
