 ******************************************************************************/

	List.c:
		A linked list for integers with markers to keep track of the
	front and rear of the double ended queue.  Includes a current-position
	marker that can move between previous and next positions.
	
	List.h:
		A header file for List.c.

	ListTest.c:
		A class made specifically to run and test List.c to see how it
	functions.
  
	Graph.c:
		Implementation file for the Graph ADT.  Contains a Dirrected
	Graph on n vertices.  Uses the List ADT to keep track of adjacent
	vertices.  Includes a Depth First Search algorithm used to find the
	strongly connected components of a Directed Graph.

	Graph.h:
		A header file for Graph.c.

	GraphTest.c
		A class made specifically to run and test Graph.c to see how
	it functions.

	FindComponents.c:
		Program "FindComponents" main.  Implements the Graph and List
	ADTs. Reads from a specified file a directed graph and uses the Depth
	First Search algorithm to to find the strongly connected components in
	the given graph.  Prints output to a specified outfile.

	Makefile:
		Used to compile all c files for this assignment on Unix.
