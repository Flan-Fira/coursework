Assignment: pa2
	This assignment contains:
		List.c
		List.h
		ListTest.c
		Shuffle.c
		Makefile
		README
		
	List.c:
		A linked list for integers with markers to keep track of the front
	and rear of the double ended queue.  Includes, as well, a current-
	position marker that can move between previous and next positions.
	
	List.h:
		A header file for List.c.

	ListTest.c:
		A class made specifically to run and test List.c to see how it
	functions.
  
	Shuffle.c:
		Reads permutations line by line from a file and shuffles a list
	the length of the permutation according to the operators found in
	the permutations.  The list is shuffled until it returns to its
	original state and the number of shuffles is counted.  The first
	shuffle along with the number of shuffles needed to return the
	list to its original state are written to a file specified by the
	user line by line with its corresponding permutation.  The first
	line read from the file by Shuffle is assumed to be the number of
	permutations in the file.

	Makefile
		Used to compile all c files for this assignment on Unix.
