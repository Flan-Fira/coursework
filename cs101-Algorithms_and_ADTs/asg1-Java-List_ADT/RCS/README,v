    README

  List.java:
    A linked list for integers with markers to keep track of the front
  and rear of the double ended queue.  Includes, as well, a current-
  position marker that can move between previous and next positions.
  
  ListTest.java:
    A class made specifically to run and test List.java to see how it
  functions.
  
  Shuffle.java:
    Reads permutations line by line from a file and shuffles a list
  the length of the permutation according to the operators found in
  the permutations.  The list is shuffled until it returns to its
  original state and the number of shuffles is counted.  The first
  shuffle along with the number of shuffles needed to return the
  list to its original state are written to a file specified by the
  user line by line with its corresponding permutation.  The first
  line read from the file by Shuffle is assumed to be the number of
  permutations in the file.
  
  Makefile
    Used to compile Shuffle.java on Unix.@
